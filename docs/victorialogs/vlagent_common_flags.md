  -http.maxGracefulShutdownDuration duration
     The maximum duration for a graceful shutdown of the HTTP server. During this period the server stops accepting new connections, but it will continue serving existing connections.

A highly loaded server may require increased value for a graceful shutdown (default 7s)
  -http.pathPrefix string
     An optional prefix to add to all the paths handled by http server. For example, if '-http.pathPrefix=/foo/bar' is set, then all the http requests will be handled on '/foo/bar/*' paths.

Set this flag to empty value in order to disable listening on any port. This mode may be useful for running multiple vlagent instances on the same server. Note that /targets and /metrics pages aren't available if -httpListenAddr=''. See also -tls and -httpListenAddr.useProxyProtocol
     Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
